This simple plugin allows you to open a random page from your Pico site by using a special, customizable link such as `yoursite.com/random`.

You can optionally scope the link to only fetch a random page from within a specific folder. For example, the link `yoursite.com/blog/random` will only choose from pages in the blog folder.

You may have certain pages that you don't want to include as a possible result. You can specify these pages as an array of strings in your config file in order to exclude them.
