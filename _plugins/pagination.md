Provides basic pagination support for Pico.  It divides up your `pages` array into a new `paged_pages` variable that allows you to limit the number of pages displayed.

If you were to render all of your default `pages` array in Pico, you'd find your entire site displayed as one long list.  Pagination allows you to break this up and limit the number of results per page, just like you'd find on most blogs.

Pagination comes with many additional Twig variables that you can use to act on your `paged_pages`, giving you the power to create paged websites with ease.
