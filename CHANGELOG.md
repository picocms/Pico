Pico Changelog
==============

**Note:** This changelog only provides technical information about the changes
          introduced with a particular Pico version, and is meant to supplement
          the actual code changes. The information in this changelog are often
          insufficient to understand the implications of larger changes. Please
          refer to both the UPGRADE and NEWS sections of the docs for more
          details.

**Note:** Changes breaking backwards compatibility (BC) are marked with an `!`
          (exclamation mark). This doesn't include changes for which BC is
          preserved by Pico's official `PicoDeprecated` plugin. If a previously
          deprecated feature is later removed in `PicoDeprecated`, this change
          is going to be marked as BC-breaking change in both Pico's and
          `PicoDeprecated`'s changelog. Please note that BC-breaking changes
          are only possible with a new major version.

### Version 3.0.0-beta.1
Released: -

```
* [New] Pico 3.0 is a major release, but comes with relatively small changes
        to Pico's core; its major change are updated dependencies (see below)
* [New] Introduce API version 4 (with barely noticable changes, see below)
* [New] Add new continous integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions
* [New] Add new build script and Makefile to simplify Pico's build and release
        process; see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details
* [New] Add `%page_id%`, `%page_url%` and `%page_path%` Markdown placeholders
        to replace the current page's ID, URL, and containing directory resp.
* [New] `Pico::prepareFileContent()` and `Pico::substituteFileContent()` both
        now receive the (optional) `$pageId` argument for the new `%page_*%`
        Markdown placeholders
* [New] Add `page()` Twig function to access a page's data
* [New] Enhance `pages_order_by_meta` functionality to allow sorting by 
            nested meta values using '.' notation (e.g., 'author.info')
* [Changed] ! Pico now requires PHP 7.2.5 or later (this includes full PHP 8
            support, also see #528, #534, #608)
* [Changed] ! Pico now depends on Twig 3.3, skipping Twig 2.x altogether; this
            is a BC-breaking change, as Twig 2.x and 3.x changed and removed
            some commonly used features; check out Twig's changelog and
            deprecation notices for details
* [Changed] ! Pico now depends on Symfony YAML 5.4, skipping various milestones
            in between; this is a BC-breaking change, because Symfony YAML
            changed its behaviour multiple times in between; check out Symfony
            YAML's changelog for details
* [Changed] ! Pico downgrades to Parsedown 1.7.4 and Parsedown Extra 0.8.1;
            this is a BC-breaking change in theory, but shouldn't have much of
            an impact in real-life scenarios
* [Changed] #603: Pico's `markdown` Twig filter now raises an error if an
            invalid variable type (e.g. an array) is passed
* [Changed] Enable PHP strict typing for Pico's internal classes; Pico's
            `PicoPluginInterface` interface and `AbstractPicoPlugin` class
            don't use strict typing to maintain BC, but you can (and should)
            enable it for your plugin (see `DummyPlugin` for an example)
* [Changed] Various other code improvements due to the upgrade to PHP 7.2
* [Fixed] #602: Fix contents and meta data of meta pages (pages starting with
          an `_`) getting replaced by the 404 page when being requested
* [Fixed] Add a proper error message for a missing theme directory
* [Removed] ! Remove Pico's `map` Twig filter; it conflicts with Twig's `map`
            filter and can be replaced by Twig's `column` or `map` filter
```

### Version 3.0.0-alpha.2
Released: 2020-12-24

```
* [Changed] Merge all fixes of Pico v2.1.2 to v2.1.4
* [Fixed] #575: Update Symfony YAML v3.4 to support PHP 8.0+
```

### Version 2.1.4
Released: 2020-08-29

```
* [Changed] Silence PHP errors in Parsedown
* [Fixed] #560: Improve charset guessing for formatted date strings using
          `strftime()` (Pico always uses UTF-8, but `strftime()` might not)
```

### Version 2.1.3
Released: 2020-07-10

```
* [New] Add `locale` option to `config/config.yml`
* [Changed] Improve Pico docs
```

Released: 2020-03-29

```

* [Changed] Update dependencies: Twig 2.12, Symfony YAML 3.4, Parsedown 1.7.4
            and Parsedown Extra 0.8.1; this is just an interim step, we'll
            update to Twig 3.0+ and Symfony YAML 5.0+ later
```

### Version 2.1.1
Released: 2019-12-31

```
* [Fixed] Require Parsedown 1.8.0-beta-7 and Parsedown Extra 0.8.0-beta-1 due
          to changes in Parsedown and Parsedown Extra breaking BC beyond repair
* [Changed] #523: Check for hidden pages based on page ID instead of full paths
* [Changed] Improve Pico docs
```

### Version 2.1.0
Released: 2019-11-24

```

### Version 2.1.0-beta.1
Released: 2019-11-03

```
* [New] Introduce API version 3
* [New] Add `assets_dir`, `assets_url` and `plugins_url` config params
* [New] Add `%config.*%` Markdown placeholders for scalar config params and the
        `%assets_url%`, `%themes_url%` and `%plugins_url%` placeholders
* [New] Add `content-sample/theme.md` for theme testing purposes
* [New] Introduce API versioning for themes and support theme-specific configs
        using the new `pico-theme.yml` in a theme's directory; `pico-theme.yml`
        allows a theme to influence Pico's Twig config, to register known meta
        headers and to provide defaults for theme config params
* [New] Add `assets_url`, `themes_url` and `plugins_url` Twig variables
* [New] Add `pages` Twig function to deal with Pico's page tree; this function
        replaces the raw usage of Pico's `pages` array in themes
* [New] Add `url` Twig filter to replace URL placeholders (e.g. `%base_url%`)
        in strings using the new `Pico::substituteUrl()` method
* [New] Add `onThemeLoading` and `onThemeLoaded` events
* [New] Add `debug` config param and the `Pico::isDebugModeEnabled()` method,
        checking the `PICO_DEBUG` environment variable, to enable debugging
* [New] Add new `Pico::getNormalizedPath()` method to normalize a path; this
        method should be used to prevent content dir breakouts when dealing
        with paths provided by user input
* [New] Add new `Pico::getUrlFromPath()` method to guess a URL from a file path
* [New] Add new `Pico::getAbsoluteUrl()` method to make a relative URL absolute
* [New] #505: Create pre-built `.zip` release archives
* [Fixed] #461: Proberly handle content files with a UTF-8 BOM

            Twig variable and Markdown placeholder are kept unchanged
* [Changed] Update to Parsedown Extra 0.8 and Parsedown 1.8 (both still beta)
* [Changed] Enable Twig's `autoescape` feature by default; outputting a
            variable now causes Twig to escape HTML markup; Pico's `content`
            variable is a notable exception, as it is marked as being HTML safe
* [Changed] Rename `prev_page` Twig variable to `previous_page`
* [Changed] Mark `markdown` and `content` Twig filters as well as the `content`
            variable as being HTML safe
* [Changed] Add `$singleLine` param to `markdown` Twig filter as well as the
            `Pico::parseFileContent()` method to parse just a single line of
            Markdown input
* [Changed] Add `AbstractPicoPlugin::configEnabled()` method to check whether
            a plugin should be enabled or disabled based on Pico's config
* [Changed] Deprecate the use of `AbstractPicoPlugin::__call()`, use
            `PicoPluginInterface::getPico()` instead
* [Changed] Update to Twig 1.36 as last version supporting PHP 5.3, use a
            Composer-based installation to use a newer Twig version
* [Changed] Add `$basePath` and `$endSlash` params to `Pico::getAbsolutePath()`
* [Changed] Deprecate `Pico::getBaseThemeUrl()`

        details; also see the `onPageTreeBuilt` event
* [Changed] Update dependencies: Twig 1.35
* [Changed] ! Improve `.htaccess` and deny access to all dot files by default
* [Changed] ! Throw a `RuntimeException` when non-native plugins are loaded,
            but Pico's `PicoDeprecated` plugin is not loaded
* [Changed] ! Change `AbstractPicoPlugin::$enabled`'s behavior: setting it to
            TRUE now leads to throwing a `RuntimeException` when the plugin's
            dependencies aren't fulfilled; use NULL to maintain old behavior
* [Changed] ! Force themes to use `.twig` as file extension for Twig templates
* [Changed] Improve PHP class docs
* [Changed] Various small improvements
```

### Version 2.0.0-beta.1
Released: 2017-11-05

```
* [New] Pico is on its way to its second major release!
* [New] Improve Pico's release & build process
* [New] Add "Developer Certificate of Origin" to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* [New] Add license & copyright header to all relevant files
* [New] Add Pico version constants (`Pico::VERSION` and `Pico::VERSION_ID`),
        and add a `version` Twig variable and `%version%` Markdown placeholder
* [New] Add Pico API versioning for plugins (see `Pico::API_VERSION` constant);
        Pico now triggers events on plugins using the latest API version only
        ("native" plugins), `PicoDeprecated` takes care of all other plugins;
        as a result, old plugin's always depend on `PicoDeprecated` now
* [New] Add a theme and plugin installer for composer; Pico now additionally
        uses the new `vendor/pico-plugin.php` file to discover plugins
        installed by composer and loads them using composer's autoloader;
        see the `picocms/composer-installer` repo for more details; Pico
        loads plugins installed by composer first and ignores conflicting
        plugins in Pico's `plugins/` dir
* [New] Add `$enableLocalPlugins` parameter to `Pico::__construct()` to allow
        website developers to disable local plugin discovery by scanning the
        `plugins/` dir (i.e. load plugins from `vendor/pico-plugin.php` only)
* [New] Add public `AbstractPicoPlugin::getPluginConfig()` method
* [New] Add public `Pico::loadPlugin()` method and the corresponding
        `onPluginManuallyLoaded` event
* [New] Add public `Pico::resolveFilePath()` method (replaces the protected
        `Pico::discoverRequestFile()` method)
* [New] Add public `Pico::is404Content()` method
* [New] Add public `Pico::getYamlParser()` method and the corresponding
        `onYamlParserRegistered` event
* [New] Add public `Pico::substituteFileContent()` method
* [New] Add public `Pico::getPageId()` method
* [New] Add public `Pico::getFilesGlob()` method
* [New] Add public `Pico::getVendorDir()` method, returning Pico's installation
        directory (i.e. `/var/www/pico/vendor/picocms/pico`); don't confuse
        this with composer's `vendor/` dir!
* [New] Add `$default` parameter to `Pico::getConfig()` method
* [New] Add empty `assets/` and `content/` dirs
* [New] #305: Add `url_param` and `form_param` Twig functions, and the public
        `Pico::getUrlParameter()` and `Pico::getFormParameter()` methods,
        allowing theme developers to access URL GET and HTTP POST parameters
* [New] Add `$meta` parameter to `markdown` Twig filter
* [New] Add `remove` fallback to `sort_by` Twig filter
* [New] Add `theme_url` config parameter
* [New] Add public `Pico::getBaseThemeUrl()` method
* [New] Add `REQUEST_URI` routing method, allowing one to simply rewrite all
        requests to `index.php` (e.g. use `FallbackResource` or `mod_rewrite`
        in your `.htaccess` for Apache, or use `try_files` for nginx)
* [New] #299: Add built-in 404 page as fallback when no `404.md` is found
* [New] Allow sorting pages by arbitrary meta values
* [New] Add `onSinglePageLoading` event, allowing one to skip a page
* [New] Add `onSinglePageContent` event
* [New] Add some config parameters to change Parsedown's behavior
* [Changed] ! Disallow running the same Pico instance multiple times by
            throwing a `RuntimeException` when calling `Pico::run()`
* [Changed] ! #203: Load plugins from `plugins/<plugin name>/<plugin name>.php`
            and `plugins/<plugin name>.php` only (directory and file name must
            match case-sensitive), and throw a `RuntimeException` when Pico is
            unable to load a plugin; also throw a `RuntimeException` when
            superfluous files or directories in `plugins/` are found; use a
            scope-isolated `require()` to include plugin files
* [Changed] ! Use a plugin dependency topology to sort `Pico::$plugins`,
            changing the execution order of plugins so that plugins, on which
            other plugins depend, are always executed before their dependants
* [Changed] ! Don't pass `$plugins` parameter to `onPluginsLoaded` event by
            reference anymore; use `Pico::loadPlugin()` instead
* [Changed] ! Leave `Pico::$pages` unsorted when a unknown sort method was
            configured; this usually means that a plugin wants to sort it
* [Changed] Overhaul page discovery events: add `onPagesDiscovered` event which
            is triggered right before `Pico::$pages` is sorted and move the
            `$currentPage`, `$previousPage` and `$nextPage` parameters of the
            `onPagesLoaded` event to the new `onCurrentPageDiscovered` event
* [Changed] Move the `$twig` parameter of the `onPageRendering` event to the
            `onTwigRegistered` event, replacing the `onTwigRegistration` event
* [Changed] Unify the `onParsedownRegistration` event by renaming it to
            `onParsedownRegistered` and add the `$parsedown` parameter
* [Changed] #330: Replace `config/config.php` by a modular YAML-based approach;
            you can now use a arbitrary number of `config/*.yml` files to
            configure Pico
* [Changed] ! When trying to auto-detect Pico's `content` dir, Pico no longer
            searches just for a (possibly empty) directory, but rather checks
            whether a `index.md` exists in this directory
* [Changed] ! Use the relative path between `index.php` and `Pico::$themesDir`
            for Pico's theme URL (also refer to the new `theme_url` config and
            the public `Pico::getBaseThemeUrl()` method for more details)
* [Changed] #347: Drop the superfluous trailing "/index" from Pico's URLs
* [Changed] Flip registered meta headers array, so that the array key is used
            to search for a meta value and the array value is used to store the
            found meta value (previously it was the other way round)
* [Changed] ! Add lazy loading for `Pico::$yamlParser`, `Pico::$parsedown` and
            `Pico::$twig`; the corresponding events are no longer part of
            Pico's event flow and are triggered on demand
* [Changed] ! Trigger the `onMetaHeaders` event just once; the event is no
            longer part of Pico's event flow and is triggered on demand
* [Changed] Don't lower meta headers on the first level of a page's meta data
            (i.e. `SomeKey: value` is accessible using `$meta['SomeKey']`)
* [Changed] Don't compare registered meta headers case-insensitive, require
            matching case
* [Changed] Allow users to explicitly set values for the `date_formatted` and
            `time` meta headers in a page's YAML front matter
* [Changed] Add page siblings for all pages
* [Changed] ! Treat pages or directories that are prefixed by `_` as hidden;
            when requesting a hidden page, Pico responds with a 404 page;
            hidden pages are still in `Pico::$pages`, but are moved to the end
            of the pages array when sorted alphabetically or by date
* [Changed] ! Don't treat explicit requests to a 404 page as successful request
* [Changed] Change method visibility of `Pico::getFiles()` to public
* [Changed] Change method visibility of `Pico::triggerEvent()` to public;
            at first glance this method triggers events on native plugins only,
            however, `PicoDeprecated` takes care of triggering events for other
            plugins, thus you can use this method to trigger (custom) events on
            all plugins; never use it to trigger Pico core events!
* [Changed] Move Pico's default theme to the new `picocms/pico-theme` repo; the
            theme was completely rewritten from scratch and is a much better
            starting point for creating your own theme; refer to the theme's
            `CHANGELOG.md` for more details
* [Changed] Move `PicoDeprecated` plugin to the new `picocms/pico-deprecated`
            repo; refer to the plugin's `CHANGELOG.md` for more details
* [Changed] Update dependencies: Twig 1.34, Symfony YAML 2.8, Parsedown 1.6
* [Changed] Improve Pico docs and PHP class docs
* [Changed] A vast number of small improvements and changes...
* [Removed] ! Remove `PicoParsePagesContent` plugin
* [Removed] ! Remove `PicoExcerpt` plugin
* [Removed] Remove `rewrite_url` and `is_front_page` Twig variables
* [Removed] Remove superfluous parameters of various events to reduce Pico's
            error-proneness (plugins hopefully interfere with each other less)

        out-of-the-box with any webserver and without URL rewriting; use

        in Twig templates to declare internal links
* [New] Brand new plugin system with dependencies (see `PicoPluginInterface`
        and `AbstractPicoPlugin`); if you're plugin dev, you really should
        take a look at the UPGRADE section of the docs!

        compatibility with Pico 0.9 and Pico 0.8

* [Changed] Exclude inaccessible files from pages list
* [Changed] With alphabetical order, index files (e.g. `sub/index.md`) are
            now always placed before their sub pages (e.g. `sub/foo.md`)

* [Changed] Pico now implicitly uses a existing `content` directory without
            the need to configure this in the `config/config.php` explicitly

            anymore, use `$pageData['raw_content']` when possible; otherwise
            use Twigs new `content` filter (e.g. `{{ "sub/page"|content }}`)
