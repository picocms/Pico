*** Pico Changelog ***

2015.11.XX - version 1.0.0-beta.1
 * NOTE: This changelog only provides basic information about the enormous
         changes introduced with Pico 1.0.0-beta.1. Please refer to the
         UGPRADE section of the docs for details.
 * [Security] (9e2604a) Prevent content_dir breakouts using malicious URLs
 * [New] Pico is on its way to its first stable release!
 * [New] Provide pre-bundled releases
 * [New] Heavily expanded documentation (inline code docs, user docs, dev docs)
 * [New] New routing system using the QUERY_STRING method; Pico now works
         out-of-the-box with any webserver and without URL rewriting; use
         `%base_url%?sub/page` in markdown files and `{{ "sub/page"|link }}`
         in Twig templates to declare internal links
 * [New] Brand new plugin system with dependencies (see `PicoPluginInterface`
         and `AbstractPicoPlugin`); if you're plugin dev, you really should
         take a look at the UPGRADE section of the docs!
 * [New] Introducing the `PicoDeprecated` plugin to maintain full backward
         compatibility with Pico 0.9 and older
 * [New] Support YAML-style meta header comments (`---`)
 * [New] Various new placeholders to use in content files (e.g. `%site_title%`)
 * [New] Provide access to all meta headers in content files (`%meta.*%`)
 * [New] Provide access to meta headers in `$page` arrays (`$page['meta']`)
 * [New] The file extension of content files is now configurable
 * [New] Add `Pico::setConfig()` method to predefine config variables
 * [New] Supporting per-directory `404.md` files
 * [New] #103: Providing access to `sub.md` even when the `sub` directory
         exists, provided that there is no `sub/index.md`
 * [New] #249: Support the `.twig` file extension for templates
 * [New] #268, 269: Now using Travis CI; performing basic code tests and
         implementing an automatic release process
 * [Changed] Complete code refactoring
 * [Changed] Source code now follows PSR code styling
 * [Changed] Replacing constants (e.g. `ROOT_DIR`) with constructor parameters
 * [Changed] Paths (e.g. `content_dir`) are now relative to Picos root dir
 * [Changed] Adding `Pico::run()` method that performs Picos processing and
             returns the rendered contents
 * [Changed] Renaming all plugin events; adding some new events
 * [Changed] `Pico_Plugin` is now the fully documented `DummyPlugin`
 * [Changed] Meta data must start on the first line of the file now
 * [Changed] Dropping the need to register meta headers for the convenience of
             users and pure (!) theme devs; plugin devs are still REQUIRED to
             register their meta headers during `onMetaHeaders`
 * [Changed] Exclude inaccessible files from pages list
 * [Changed] With alphabetical order, index files (e.g. `sub/index.md`) are
             now always placed before their sub pages (e.g. `sub/foo.md`)
 * [Changed] Pico requires PHP >= 5.3.6 (due to `erusev/parsedown-extra`)
 * [Changed] Composer: Require a v0.7 release of `erusev/parsedown-extra`
 * [Changed] #93, #158: Pico doesn't parse all content files anymore; moved to
             `PicoParsePagesContent` plugin, but still impacts performance;
             Note: This means `$page['content']` isn't available anymore, but
             usually the new `$page['raw_content']` is suitable as replacement.
 * [Changed] #116: Parse meta headers using the Symfony YAML component
 * [Changed] #244: Replace opendir() with scandir()
 * [Changed] #246: Move `config.php` to `config/` directory
