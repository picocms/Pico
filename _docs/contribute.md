## Contribute

You want to contribute to Pico? We really appreciate that! You can help make Pico better by [contributing code][PullRequests] or [reporting issues][Issues], but please take note of our [contribution guidelines][ContributionGuidelines]. In general you can contribute in three different areas:

1. Plugins & Themes: You're a plugin developer or theme designer? We love you guys! You can find tons of information about how to develop plugins and themes at [{{ site.base_url }}/plugin-dev.html][PluginDocs]. If you have created a plugin or theme, please add it to our [Wiki][], either on the [plugins][WikiPlugins] or [themes page][WikiThemes]. Doing so, we may select and promote your plugin or theme on [our website][OfficialPlugins] as officially supported!

2. Documentation: We always appreciate people improving our documentation. You can either improve the [inline user docs][EditInlineDocs] or the more extensive [user docs on our website][EditUserDocs]. You can also improve the [docs for plugin and theme developers][EditDevDocs]. Simply fork Pico from [{{ site.gh_project_url }}][GitHub], change the Markdown files and open a [pull request][PullRequests].

3. Pico's Core: The supreme discipline is to work on Pico's Core. Your contribution should help *every* Pico user to have a better experience with Pico. If this is the case, fork Pico from ({{ site.gh_project_url }})[GitHub] and open a [pull request][PullRequests]. We look forward to your contribution!
