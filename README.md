Install
-------

Installing Pico is dead simple - and done in seconds! If you have access to a shell on your server (i.e. SSH access), we recommend using [Composer][]. If not, use a pre-bundled release. If you don't know what "SSH access" is, head over to the pre-bundled release. ðŸ˜‡

Pico requires PHP 5.3.6+ and the PHP extensions `dom` and `mbstring` to be enabled.

### I want to use Composer

Starting with Pico 2.0 we recommend installing Pico using Composer whenever possible. Trust us, you won't regret it when it comes to upgrading Pico! Anyway, if you don't want to use Composer, or if you simply can't use Composer because you don't have access to a shell on your server, don't despair, installing Pico using a pre-bundled release is still easier than everything you know!

###### Step 1

Open a shell and navigate to the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html`) of your server. Download Composer and run it with the `create-project` option to install it to the desired directory (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico`):

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar create-project picocms/pico-composer pico
```

###### Step 2

What second step? There's no second step. That's it! Open your favorite web browser and navigate to your brand new, stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS! Pico's sample contents will explain how to create your own contents. ðŸ˜Š

### I want to use a pre-bundled release

Do you know the feeling: You want to install a new website, so you upload all files of your favorite CMS and run the setup script - just to find out that you forgot about creating the SQL database first? Later the setup script tells you that the file permissions are wrong. Heck, what does this even mean? Forget about it, Pico is different!

###### Step 1

[Download the latest Pico release][LatestRelease] and upload all files to the desired install directory of Pico within the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico`) of your server.

###### Step 2

Okay, here's the catch: There's no catch. That's it! Open your favorite web browser and navigate to your brand new, stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS! Pico's sample contents will explain how to create your own contents. ðŸ˜Š

### I want to manage my website using a Git repository

Git is a very powerful distributed version-control system - and it can be used to establish a nice workflow around your Pico website. Using a Git repository for your website aids content creation and deployment, including collaborative editing and version control. If you want to manage your website in a Git repository, you use a Composer-based installation.

1. Fork [Pico's Composer starter project][PicoComposerGit] using [GitHub's fork button][HelpFork]. If you don't want to use GitHub you aren't required to, you can choose whatever Git server you want. Forking manually just requires some extra steps: First clone the Git repository locally, add your Git server as a remote and push the repository to this new remote.

2. Clone your fork locally and add your contents and assets. You can edit Pico's `composer.json` to include 3rd-party plugins and themes, or simply add your own plugins and themes to Pico's `plugins` resp. `themes` directories. Don't forget to commit your changes and push them to your Git server.

3. Open a shell on your webserver and navigate to the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html`). Download Composer, clone your Git repository to the desired directory (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico`) and install Pico's dependencies using Composer's `install` option:

    ```shell
    $ curl -sSL https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY> pico
    $ php composer.phar --working-dir=pico install
    ```

4. If you update your website's contents, simply commit your changes and push them to your Git server. Open a shell on your webserver and navigate to Pico's install directory within the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico`) of your server. Pull all changes from your Git server and update Pico's dependencies using Composer's `update` option:

    ```shell
    $ git pull
    $ php composer.phar update
    ```

### I'm a developer

So, you're one of these amazing people making all of this possible? We love you folks! As a developer we recommend you to clone [Pico's Git repository][PicoGit] as well as the Git repositories of [Pico's default theme][PicoThemeGit] and the [`PicoDeprecated` plugin][PicoDeprecatedGit]. You can set up your workspace using [Pico's Composer starter project][PicoComposerGit] and include all of Pico's components using local packages.

Using Pico's Git repositories is different from using one of the installation methods elucidated above. It gives you the current development version of Pico, what is likely *unstable* and *not ready for production use*!

1. Open a shell and navigate to the desired directory of Pico's development workspace within the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico`) of your server. Download and extract Pico's Composer starter project into the `workspace` directory:

    ```shell
    $ curl -sSL https://github.com/picocms/pico-composer/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xz
    $ mv pico-composer-master workspace
    ```

2. Clone the Git repositories of all Pico components (Pico's core, Pico's default theme and the `PicoDeprecated` plugin) into the `components` directory:

    ```shell
    $ mkdir components
    $ git clone https://github.com/picocms/Pico.git components/pico
    $ git clone https://github.com/picocms/pico-theme.git components/pico-theme
    $ git clone https://github.com/picocms/pico-deprecated.git components/pico-deprecated
    ```

3. Instruct Composer to use the local Git repositories as replacement for the `picocms/pico` (Pico's core), `picocms/pico-theme` (Pico's default theme) and `picocms/pico-deprecated` (the `PicoDeprecated` plugin) packages. Update the `composer.json` of your development workspace (i.e. `workspace/composer.json`) accordingly:

    ```json
    {
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "path",
                "url": "../components/pico",
                "options": { "symlink": true }
            },
            {
                "type": "path",
                "url": "../components/pico-theme",
                "options": { "symlink": true }
            },
            {
                "type": "path",
                "url": "../components/pico-deprecated",
                "options": { "symlink": true }
            }
        ],
        "require": {
            "picocms/pico": "dev-master",
            "picocms/pico-theme": "dev-master",
            "picocms/pico-deprecated": "dev-master",
            "picocms/composer-installer": "^1.0"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Download Composer and run it with the `install` option:

    ```shell
    $ curl -sSL https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar --working-dir=workspace install
    ```

You can now open your web browser and navigate to Pico's development workspace. All changes you make to Pico's components will automatically be reflected in the development workspace.

By the way, you can also find all of Pico's components on [Packagist.org][Packagist]: [Pico's core][PicoPackagist], [Pico's default theme][PicoThemePackagist], the [`PicoDeprecated` plugin][PicoDeprecatedPackagist] and [Pico's Composer starter project][PicoComposerPackagist].

Upgrade
-------

Do you remember when you installed Pico? It was ingeniously simple, wasn't it? Upgrading Pico is no difference! The upgrade process differs depending on whether you used [Composer][] or a pre-bundled release to install Pico. Please note that you should *always* create a backup of your Pico installation before upgrading!

Pico follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0][SemVer] and uses version numbers like `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`. When we update the `PATCH` version (e.g. `2.0.0` to `2.0.1`), we made backwards-compatible bug fixes. If we change the `MINOR` version (e.g. `2.0` to `2.1`), we added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. Upgrading Pico is dead simple in both cases. Simply head over to the appropriate Upgrade sections below.

But wait, we forgot to mention what happens when we update the `MAJOR` version (e.g. `2.0` to `3.0`). In this case we made incompatible API changes. We will then provide a appropriate upgrade tutorial, so please head over to the ["Upgrade" page on our website][HelpUpgrade].

### I've used Composer to install Pico

Upgrading Pico is dead simple if you've used Composer to install Pico. Simply open a shell and navigate to Pico's install directory within the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico`) of your server. You can now upgrade Pico using just a single command:

```shell
$ php composer.phar update
```

That's it! Composer will automatically update Pico and all plugins and themes you've installed using Composer. Please make sure to manually update all plugins and themes you've installed manually.

### I've used a pre-bundled release to install Pico

Okay, installing Pico was easy, but upgrading Pico is going to be hard, isn't it? I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. It's just as simple as installing Pico!

First you'll have to delete the `vendor` directory of your Pico installation (e.g. if you've installed Pico to `/var/www/html/pico`, delete `/var/www/html/pico/vendor`). Then [download the latest Pico release][LatestRelease] and upload all files to your existing Pico installation directory. You will be prompted whether you want to overwrite files like `index.php`, `.htaccess`, ... - simply hit "Yes".

That's it! Now that Pico is up-to-date, you need to update all plugins and themes you've installed.

### I'm a developer

As a developer you should know how to stay up-to-date... ðŸ˜‰ For the sake of completeness, if you want to upgrade Pico, simply open a shell and navigate to Pico's development workspace (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico`). Then pull the latest commits from the Git repositories of [Pico's core][PicoGit], [Pico's default theme][PicoThemeGit] and the [`PicoDeprecated` plugin][PicoDeprecatedGit]. Let Composer update your dependencies and you're ready to go.

```shell
$ git -C components/pico pull
$ git -C components/pico-theme pull
$ git -C components/pico-deprecated pull
$ php composer.phar --working-dir=workspace update
```

By contributing to Pico, you accept and agree to the *Developer Certificate of Origin* for your present and future contributions submitted to Pico. Please refer to the ["Developer Certificate of Origin" section in our `CONTRIBUTING.md`][ContributionGuidelinesDCO].

You don't have time to contribute code to Pico, but still want to "stand a coffee" for the ones who do? You can contribute monetary to Pico using [Bountysource][], a crowd funding website that focuses on individual issues and feature requests. Just refer to the "Bounties and Fundraisers" section below for more info.

Bounties and Fundraisers
------------------------

Pico uses [Bountysource][] to allow monetary contributions to the project. Bountysource is a crowd funding website that focuses on individual issues and feature requests in Open Source projects using micropayment. Users, or "Backers", can pledge money for fixing a specific issue, implementing new features, or developing a new plugin or theme. Open source software developers, or "Bounty Hunters", can then pick up and solve these tasks to earn the money.

Obviously this won't allow a developer to replace a full time job, it's rather aiming to "stand a coffee". However, it helps bringing users and developers closer together, and shows developers what users want and how much they care about certain things. Nevertheless you can still donate money to the project itself, as an easy way to say "Thank You" and to support Pico.

If you want to encourage developers to [fix a specific issue][Issues] or implement a feature, simply [pledge a new bounty][Bountysource] or back an existing one.

As a developer you can pick up a bounty by simply contributing to Pico (please refer to the "Contributing" section above). You don't have to be a official Pico Contributor! Pico is a Open Source project, anyone can open [pull requests][PullRequests] and claim bounties.

Official Pico Contributors won't claim bounties on their own behalf, Pico will never take any money out of Bountysource. All money collected by Pico is used to pledge new bounties or to support projects Pico depends on.
